<h1>Motion detection sensor</h1>
This project was developed for Carefit mobile application. It involved the development of a sensor that uses javascript's DeviceOrientationEvent to get the phone's gyroscope data
and manipulate this data to track how many times an exercise movement (reps) has been done by the user.

<h1>Carefit</h1>
The rationale behind the CareFit Carer Support App stems from a comprehensive analysis of the prevailing challenges faced by carers when attempting to incorporate regular physical activity into their daily lives. Traditional exercise tracking methods, such as manual counting or using standalone wearable devices, often prove cumbersome, inaccurate, and fail to provide real-time feedback. As a result, users may struggle to stay motivated, track their progress, and adhere to their fitness goals. Recognizing the need for an innovative approach, CareFit was conceived as an integrated solution that seamlessly combines physical activity monitoring, progress tracking, and motivational support into a single, user-friendly platform. The mobile application offers a range of physical activity that users can undertake which are mainly muscle and balance, cardiovascular and sedentary breaker. These physical activities form the core of CareFit. It endeavours to foster a positive exercise experience by combining the transtheoretical model of behavioural change with the power of advanced technology. CareFit aimed to address the challenge of lack of physical activity by providing users with a comprehensive tool to monitor their exercise levels, track their progress, stay motivated to achieve their fitness goals, learn more about physical activity and the benefits of engaging in it and access to health and wellbeing communities. 

<h1>Running the project</h1>
Once you clone the app in your local either by running git commands or downloading a zip file, navigate to the index.html file and 
open with a live server or through any method you deem suitable.

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>BootStrap</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>TypeScript</li>
</ul>

<h1>Hosting</h1>
The web application was hosted using the CIS devweb server, which necessitated a connection to the server by utilizing cyberduck after which the relevant files for the web application were uploaded to the server. A further connection was made to the server in Visual studio code by using the SFTP extension which allowed any change made to the files in the workspace to automatically update in the server. The sensor can be accessed <a href="https://master.d1nxw5m83evnbx.amplifyapp.com/">here</a>.

<h1>Extending the Sensor </h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    Expand sensor integration: There is potential to explore further integration of other in-built sensors such as the magnetometer and accelerometer sensor. Investigating their applications in exercise tracking could provide a more comprehensive understanding of user movements and enhance the overall accuracy of the sensor-based system.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enhance user experience: Implementing real-time audio feedback on the web client interface. This could involve providing audio cues synchronized with the gyroscope data to guide users through correct movement patterns during their workouts.
  </li>
  <li>Cloud integration for data storage</li>
  <li>Integration with wearable devices</li>
  <li>Enhance sensor accuracy for all exercise types</li>
  <li>Expand exercise catalogue: Expanding the range of supported exercises to offer users a more comprehensive workout experience. </li>
</ul>
